# VScript

This is a SourceMod plugin that exposes VScript stuffs to make use of it. This is still WIP as more natives are being added, and for me to finish this readme later. 

Theoretically this can work for all Games that uses VScript, but I only tested and have a gamedata for TF2, and do not have the time for other games.
