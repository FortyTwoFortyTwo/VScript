# VScript


This is a proof of concept to get the address of a VScript function. Just one native `VScript_GetFunctionAddress` to get the address by class and function name, which address can then be used for SDKCall and DHooks.


Theoretically this can work for all Games that uses VScript, but I only tested and have a gamedata for TF2, and do not have the time for other games.
